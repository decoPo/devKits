# Development Kits Repository

This repository contains a collection of development kits I have designed for various purposes. The main goal of this project is to provide versatile tools for testing, learning, and prototyping, while also exploring new ideas and concepts in hardware design. 

## Why This Project Exists?

The development kits in this repository were created to:

- Test and evaluate interesting electronic components.
- Experiment with and validate different communication interfaces.
- Serve as reference materials for learning and studying electronics.
- Enable hacking and tinkering with new ideas.
- Provide custom development tools tailored for my clients' needs.

Each devkit is designed with a specific purpose in mind, but they are versatile enough to be used in a variety of projects, from education to advanced prototyping.

## List of Development Kits
